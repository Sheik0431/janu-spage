    <h2>Birth and delivery</h2>
    <div class="first"><img src="./pexels-lisa-fotios-2721581.jpg" alt="">
    <p> Labor is the stage during which the uterus contracts and the cervix dilates in preparation for delivery. This stage can last for several hours or even days, and the mother may experience pain and discomfort as the baby moves down the birth canal.
    
        During the delivery stage, the baby is born through the birth canal. This stage typically lasts for a few minutes to an hour or more, depending on various factors such as the position of the baby and the size of the birth canal.</p></div>
        <div class="second">

            <p>Afterbirth refers to the delivery of the placenta, which is the organ that nourished the baby during pregnancy. This usually happens within a few minutes to an hour after the baby is born.
    
                There are different methods of childbirth available, including natural birth, water birth, and C-section. The choice of method may depend on various factors such as the mother's health, the position of the baby, and any complications that may arise during labor.</p>
